## Constitutional Governance

All development work MUST comply with the project constitution at `.specify/memory/constitution.md`.

Key principles enforced:
- **MCP Tooling Mandate**: Use prescribed MCP tools for documentation (Ref), database (Supabase), and payments (Stripe)
- **Security & Configuration**: Never hard-code secrets; use environment variables with secure storage
- **Technology Stack Alignment**: Follow approved stack (React Native + Expo SDK 51+, Node.js 18+)
- **Git Commit Discipline**: Commit all changes immediately after completing each implementation task

Refer to the full constitution for complete principles and enforcement procedures.
